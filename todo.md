# TODO

- Aggregate constraints: for all courses: included (course) for example
    - For some course: included (course)

- Defining scopes

- Prerequisite courses

- Activation of modules (using module activator)
    - Write the appropriate DSL interpretation for it

- Write the documentation
- Write the report

## Optional

- References to ModuleConstraints instead of inline definitions (with errormsg, description and everything)

## To put in the report

- The use of heterogeneous lists to parse any argument in any order
- Explain the reasoning behind the activation of modules (function vs data structure, why?)

### Possible improvements in the future

- Remove the redundant komma at the end of an object definition
- Better reference handling
- Ability to use databases to get the course data (is now all present in the file which is not optimal)
- Editors for the begeleiders (real front end) to edit the study programs.

- Explain why you chose to do the data constructor for activator instead of a function from ISPOptions to a boolean
